# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis was to use unsupervised machine learning to group available cryptocurrency so that an investment company can develop a new portofolio to offer to clients. Data on all available cryptocurrency was processed in order to remove any data that did not contain all the information needed for the analysis. The data was then clustered using K-means.
